## **Introduction:**

This project is a frogger-like arcade game. The project was created as part of Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program. 

In order to play the game open the `.html` file in the repository using any browser.

## **Usage:**
    
   The object of the game is for the player to reach the water without touching the enemy bugs.
          
   To move the player use the up-down-left-right buttons in your computer's keyboard.
    
   When you reach the water, an alert will let you know you've won, however if you have a collision with a bug you will lose and the game will reset.
